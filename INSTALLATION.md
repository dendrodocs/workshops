# Installation & Setup

Use these instructions to obtain the workshop files and decide how you want to work with them. Each language track may have additional prerequisites, so after setting up the repo, consult the installation guide for the track you want to follow.

## Choose your environment

### Online

- Open the repository in the GitHub web editor by pressing `.` on the repo page.
- Or launch the project in a dev container such as [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

### Offline

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dendrodocs/workshops.git
   ```
2. Or download the ZIP from [GitHub](https://github.com/dendrodocs/workshops/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it locally.

Git is only required for cloning or downloading the repository. The workshop exercises themselves only need the tools noted in each language track.

## Next steps

After obtaining the workshop, open the README of the language track you want to follow. For example, the .NET track includes [additional installation steps](part1/dotnet/INSTALLATION.md) for the required SDK and IDE.
