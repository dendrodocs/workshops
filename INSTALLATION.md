# Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the workshop files and prepare your environment. Each language track may have extra prerequisites, so check the installation guide for that track after completing these steps.

## Get the workshop

You can work through the material online or offline:

1. **Online through GitHub**
   - Use the GitHub web editor or open the repository in a dev container.
2. **Offline on your machine**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/dendrodocs/workshops.git
     ```
   - Or download the ZIP from [GitHub](https://github.com/dendrodocs/workshops/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it locally.

Git is only required for cloning or downloading the repository. The workshop exercises themselves only need the tools noted in each language track.

## Next steps

After obtaining the workshop, open the README of the language track you want to follow. For example, the .NET track includes [additional installation steps](part1/dotnet/INSTALLATION.md) for the required SDK and IDE.
