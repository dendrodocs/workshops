# Installation & Setup

This workshop requires a few tools before you can start exploring the chapters.
Before continuing, follow the [Installation & Setup](../../INSTALLATION.md) guide at the repository root to download the workshop files. Then install the prerequisites below so you can run the exercises and open the provided solutions.

## Prerequisites

- Install the [**.NET 8 SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
- Chapter&nbsp;1 relies on [**Visual Studio 2022**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) because it includes the **Syntax Visualizer** and **DGML** tools.
- The rest of the chapters work in [**Visual Studio 2022**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Other IDEs might work, but specific instructions are not provided.


## Opening the solutions

Each chapter has a ready-made solution in the `solutions` folder. Open the solution for the chapter you are working on:

1. Navigate to `solutions/<chapter-number>`.
2. Open the `.sln` or project folder in Visual Studio or VS Code.
3. Restore packages if prompted, then follow the steps in the corresponding chapter to explore the code.

## Tips

- In VS Code, installing the **C# Dev Kit** and **C#** extensions from Microsoft provides a smoother experience.
- Use Visual Studio's built-in Syntax Visualizer and DGML editors for Chapter&nbsp;1.

Once your environment is set up, you're ready to dive into the chapters and start analyzing .NET projects with Roslyn.
