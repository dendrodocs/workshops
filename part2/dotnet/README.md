# Generating .NET Documentation

Welcome to the second part of the DendroDocs workshop for .NET.
Here you’ll use the analysis output from Part 1 to create living documentation.

Ideally, you would generate documentation for a project you already know well.
Because that’s not an option in this workshop, we’ll use the open source [Pitstop](https://github.com/EdwinVW/pitstop) project as a shared reference point.
This sample provides enough code to demonstrate how DendroDocs works without requiring in-depth domain knowledge.

This part focuses on the tooling provided by DendroDocs for .NET projects.
We’ll begin by producing the intermediate JSON file that drives all other documentation steps.

## Workshop Outline

1. [Generate an Intermediate File](01-generate-intermediate-file.md)

   Clone the sample project and run the analyzer to produce a JSON file for the rest of this part.
