# DendroDocs Workshops - Part 2: Generating Documentation

Welcome to **Part 2** of the **DendroDocs Workshops**!

In this part we'll switch gears. Documentation should be written for your stakeholders. This can be a product owner, a customer, your team, yourself in 6 months, etc.
What exactly is good documentation, and how it fits your situation is not something I can write down for you.

As every code base is different and the right form of documentation should be tailored for the right audience, I can only show you techniques you can use.
It is not possible to provide you with one tool that will produce everything you need or want.

You will be using [DendroDocs](https://github.com/DendroDocs) as part of the workshop. This is not a requirement to generate documentation in your own projects.
But it is built on experience of doing this in a couple of projects and will save a lot of time to get you started.

As DendroDocs is open source, you can replace any method with your own version to tailor the documentation to your needs.
Of course, issues and pull requests are always welcome if you see something to improve.

In this section, you'll learn how to turn the JSON output created in Part 1 into a variety of documentation formats.
We'll explore generating text files such as Markdown and creating diagrams with tools like PlantUML, ensuring your documentation always reflects your source code.

Enjoy automating your documentation and keeping everything in sync with your projects!
