# DendroDocs Workshops - Part 2: Generating Documentation

Welcome to **Part 2** of the **DendroDocs Workshops**!

In this part, we focus on turning the JSON output from [Part 1](../part1/README.md) into practical documentation formats.
We will show how to generate text files like Markdown and create diagrams with tools such as PlantUML, keeping your documentation up to date with your code.

Good documentation always depends on the needs of your stakeholders,
whether that’s a product owner, a customer, your team, or even your future self.
Every code base is different, so there is no single solution that works for everyone.

During the workshop, we’ll demonstrate useful techniques and best practices.
We use [DendroDocs](https://github.com/dendrodocs) as our example tool.
While you don’t have to use DendroDocs in your own projects, it’s built on experience from real-world projects and can help you get started faster.

DendroDocs is open source and flexible. You can adjust or replace any method to suit your needs.
Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
