# Welcome to the DendroDocs Workshops!

Explore the world of **DendroDocs** and learn how to generate living documentation directly from your source code!
These workshops guide you through analyzing syntax trees in various programming languages,
offering hands-on experience to automate documentation in a way that stays synchronized with your codebase.
You’ll start with DendroDocs as the default tool but can adapt it to fit the needs of any project.

See [Installation & Setup](INSTALLATION.md) to download the workshop files and prepare your environment.

## Who should follow this workshop?

This workshop is for developers, technical writers, DevOps engineers, and anyone curious about making documentation easy, reliable, and always up-to-date.
By the end, you’ll understand how to use DendroDocs effectively to create and maintain living documentation across different languages and ecosystems.

## What will you Learn?

* **Understanding Analyzers**: Gain insight into how analyzers work by exploring syntax trees, semantic models,
and how to parse and interpret code to create valuable documentation.
* **Generating Documentation**: Discover how to transform analysis results into a range of documentation types,
from class and sequence diagrams to text-based files, keeping everything in sync with your source code.

### Workshop Structure

The workshop is organized into two main parts, each containing focused chapters and sections:

1. **[Part 1: Understanding Analyzers](part1/README.md)**

   Get to the core of source tree analysis.
   This section will equip you with the knowledge to effectively use analyzers in your projects.

2. **[Part 2: Generating Documentation](part2/README.md)**

   Learn how to utilize the JSON outputs from the analyzers to create different types of documentation.
   Whether it's text-based files like Markdown or visual representations like PlantUML diagrams, you'll master the art of keeping documentation up-to-date.

## Hands-On Approach

The workshops offer a structured, hands-on approach using DendroDocs as the default implementation for your projects.
You're welcome to start with DendroDocs and switch to your own implementation if it better fits your project's needs.
